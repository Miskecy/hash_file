# SHA-256 File Hasher
A simple Python script to compute the **SHA-256 hash** of a file and log it to a file, **without overwriting previous entries**.  
Each log entry includes the **timestamp, file name, and hash value**.

## Features
- Calculates **SHA-256 hash** of a given file
- **Appends** hash results to a log file instead of overwriting
- Stores **timestamp, file name, and hash**
- Allows specifying a custom output log file
- **GUI applications** available for drag-and-drop functionality:
  - **File Hasher GUI**: Generate and log hashes by dragging files
  - **Hash Verifier GUI**: Verify file integrity against previously logged hashes

## Installation
Ensure you have Python **3.7+** installed, then clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sha256-file-hasher.git
cd sha256-file-hasher
```

For the GUI applications, you'll need the tkinterdnd2 library for drag-and-drop support:
```bash
pip install tkinterdnd2
```

## Command-Line Usage
Run the script with a file path as an argument:
```bash
python sha256-file-hasher.py <file_path>
```

### Optional Arguments:
| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `<file_path>` | The path to the file to hash | Required |
| `-o, --output <log_file>` | Path to save hash log | hash_log.txt |

### Examples:
Hash a file and save to default log (hash_log.txt):
```bash
python sha256-file-hasher.py myfile.txt
```
Specify a custom output file for logging:
```bash
python sha256-file-hasher.py myfile.txt -o my_hashes.log
```

## GUI Applications

### File Hasher GUI
A graphical interface for hashing files with drag-and-drop functionality.

**Features:**
- Drag and drop multiple files to hash them at once
- Select output log file location
- View hashing results in real-time
- Process files in background to keep interface responsive

**Usage:**
```bash
python sha256-file-hasher-GUI.py
```

### Hash Verifier GUI
A tool to verify if files have been modified by comparing current hashes with previously recorded hashes.

**Features:**
- Load hash records from log files
- Drag and drop files to verify their integrity
- Color-coded results showing matches and modifications
- Detailed comparison of stored vs. current hashes
- Summary statistics of verification results

**Usage:**
```bash
python sha256-file-hasher-verifier-GUI.py
```
